# UsabilityHub-FrontEnd-Clone

A "Usability Hub Front Clone" (not responsive) built with Tailwind CSS, HTML, and CSS is a simplified, static web interface that mimics the design and layout of UsabilityHub's front-end, but without responsiveness for mobile devices. Key features of this clone would include:

Layout and Design: Matches UsabilityHub's front-end structure, with elements like header, navigation bar, content sections, and footer.

Styling with Tailwind CSS: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for utility-first design, making it easier to adjust styles and layout without writing custom CSS rules.

Static Content: Primarily HTML structure, with minimal dynamic elements.
